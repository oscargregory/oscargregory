## My Cybersecurity Road Map

*This is the process that I will be taking (feel free to critique, cybersecurity professionals) based on the research I have done online. I will not return to university; I will be using a collection of online resources to learn fundamentals, technical skills, and industry-standard software. (Most of these will be posted in project repositories)*

- **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** (*completed*)
  - *Start applying for entry-level IT / cybersecurity jobs*
- **CompTIA Security+ Certification** (*in progress*)
  - *Start applying for IT helpdesk / entry-level cybersecurity jobs*
- **Learn to build and understand Networks** (*completed*)
  - *Cisco Packet Tracer Course*
- **Linux Server Setup and Configuration** (*not started*)
  - *Portfolio Project setting up a Linux server from scratch, and configuring it for a specific purpose such as web hosting, file sharing, or a personal cloud.*
- **Create Sandbox Environment with Kali Linux for Malware Analysis** (*not started*)
- **Practice ethical hacking on HackTheBox and TryHackMe** (*ongoing â€“ projects coming soon*)
- **Continued practice and learning of SQL, Markdown, HTML, and Python languages** (*ongoing - projects coming soon*)
- **Create content to teach people what I have learned** (*not started*)
