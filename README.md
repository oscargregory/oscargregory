# Gregory Blattler ðŸ‘‹

<h2>Hi, my name is Greg, I am a 32-year-old business school graduate who spent the last ten years in the Oil and Gas industry and I just quit my job to pursue a career in computers and cybersecurity. Yikes!



</h2>
<h3> I am dedicating this github profile to showcasing my journey to learning Cybersecurity and my path to breaking into the industry and getting my first job.</h3>
