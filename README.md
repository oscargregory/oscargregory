## Life Events That Sparked My Interest in Computers and Cybersecurity

- **Boris Grishenko from Goldeneye**
- **Speedrunning videogames**
- **Learning exploits, botting, and hacking in Diablo 2**
- **Creating a financially lucrative botnet in Korean MMORPG**
- **Listening to 70 episodes of Darknet Diaries in 5 days**
- **Using Kali Linux for the first time to make a phishing email example (for fun, never deployed)**
- **Thinking of ways to break the system before thinking of ways to follow the rules**
- **Experiencing TOR / darkweb / Silk Road at the ripe age of 19**
- **Learning how to mine Bitcoin in 2012 and linking up 10 computers in a lab at university to do it. _(before I knew about laws and ethics :S)_**

## My Cybersecurity Road Map

*This is the process that I will be taking (feel free to critique, cybersecurity professionals) based on the research I have done online. I will not return to university; I will be using a collection of online resources to learn fundamentals, technical skills, and industry-standard software. (Most of these will be posted in project repositories)*

- **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** (*completed*)
  - *Start applying for entry-level IT / cybersecurity jobs*
- **CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+ Certifications** (*in progress*)
  - *Start applying for IT helpdesk / entry-level cybersecurity jobs*
- **Learn to build and understand Networks** (*completed*)
  - *Cisco Packet Tracer Course*
- **Linux Server Setup and Configuration** (*not started*)
  - *Portfolio Project setting up a Linux server from scratch, and configuring it for a specific purpose such as web hosting, file sharing, or a personal cloud.*
- **Create Sandbox Environment with Kali Linux for Malware Analysis** (*not started*)
- **Practice ethical hacking on HackTheBox and TryHackMe** (*ongoing â€“ projects coming soon*)
- **Continued practice and learning of SQL, Markdown, HTML, and Python languages** (*ongoing - projects coming soon*)
- **Create content to teach people what I have learned** (*not started*)
