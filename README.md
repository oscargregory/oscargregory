<h2>Hi, my name is Greg, I am a 32-year-old business school graduate who spent the last ten years in the Oil and Gas industry and I just quit my job to pursue a career in computers and cybersecurity. Yikes!



</h2>
<h3> I am dedicating this github profile to showcasing my journey to learning Cybersecurity and my path to breaking into the industry and getting my first job.</h3>

## My Cybersecurity Road Map

*This is the process that I will be taking (feel free to critique, cybersecurity professionals) based on the research I have done online. I will not return to university; I will be using a collection of online resources to learn fundamentals, technical skills, and industry-standard software. (Most of these will be posted in project repositories)*

- **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** (*completed*)
  - Start applying for entry-level IT / Cybersecurity jobs
- **CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+ Certifications** (*in progress*)
  - Start applying for IT Helpdesk / entry-level cybersecurity jobs
- **Learn to build and understand Networks** (*completed*)
  - Cisco Packet Tracer Course
- **Linux Server Setup and Configuration** (*not started*)
  - Portfolio Project setting up a Linux server from scratch, and configuring it for a specific purpose such as web hosting, file sharing, or a personal cloud.
- **Create Sandbox Environment with Kali Linux for Malware Analysis** (*not started*)
- **Practice ethical hacking on HackTheBox and TryHackMe** (*ongoing â€“ projects coming soon*)
