# Gregory Blattler ðŸ‘‹

<h2>Hi, my name is Greg, I am a 32-year-old business school graduate who spent the last ten years in the Oil and Gas industry and I just quit my job to pursue a career in computers and cybersecurity. Yikes!

I am dedicating this github profile to showcasing my journey to learning Cybersecurity and my path to breaking into the industry and getting my first job.

I am a lifelong learner and extremely passionate about learning everything I can!

###Who Am I?
*Life-long Learner
*Passionate and fascinated by all things computers
*Self-taught, highly motivated and disciplined

###Why Cybersecurity?
*I have been curious about this field since I was a child, without ever even noticing it. I think, like most people who dive into this area of the profession, were triggered at some point by being fascinated by some type of "hacker" they saw in a movie or TV show. My fascination came from 007 Golden Eye, where Boris was my favorite character haha. "I AM INVINCIBLE"
*I have loved computers all of my life, and want to be more fluent in the language of computers.
