# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Greg, a Business School graduate with 10 years of experience working in the operations side of the Oil and Gas industry in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

The past 5 years have taught me what I want in a career, and what I want out of life. I have always had a passion burning inside me to do something that would harness my love for computers and the technology industry.
This is my journey to pursuing that passion. This profile will outline my transition into that world.

###Who Am I?
*Life-long Learner
*Passionate and fascinated by all things computers
*Self-taught, highly motivated and disciplined

###Why Cybersecurity?
*I have been curious about this field since I was a child, without ever even noticing it. I think, like most people who dive into this area of the profession, were triggered at some point by being fascinated by some type of "hacker" they saw in a movie or TV show. My fascination came from 007 Golden Eye, where Boris was my favorite character haha. "I AM INVINCIBLE"
*I have loved computers all of my life, and want to be more fluent in the language of computers.
